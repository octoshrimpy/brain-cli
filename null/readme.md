So earlier I [19] noticed that my Brother [8] wasn't anywhere downstairs so I decided to ask my mum where he was and she said that he was in bed, I thought this was kinda strange as it wasn't anywhere close to bedtime and my other siblings were still around. So I went upstairs to check in on the little guy and there he was in his bed all cozy with his Switch in his hand (he's a pretty nervous person), I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was starting a new Pokemon play-through. This little guy has been obsessed with these games for years and its all he thinks about most of the time, me and him bond over it as I have some knowledge of the franchise but it never goes beyond a small conversation as I am often busy. He tries to talk to everyone about it but most people don't know how to talk to him back and I think that really gets him down sometimes. Well tonight, when he was in bed I had a huge conversation with him about it and the pure joy on his face was just adorable, he would giggle as we would talk about what was good against one Pokemon and he'd do a silent impression of a Pokemon fainting and I couldn't help myself but laugh with him, during this he had the most adorable little smile, he was so happy to share this interest with me and so was I. It was then that I comprehended and cried at the beautiful soul this boy had, He couldn't hurt a fly. Gosh I love my brother so much, he really deserves the world.
