v0.5.1
------

Setting property 'match' in branches is now optional (no match property = always match)
New: 'transition' property, similar to delay, but do not even apply former state's actions
KFG improved (50% done)


v0.5.0
------

BREAKING: styles are now part of the exported program, and should be referenced by its name (property where it is stored inside program.styles), this will allow styles to be superseded by a text-editor (e.g.: have a common style for all identifiers across all supported languages, etc)


v0.4.1
------

New embedded feature is added, new languages: CSS and Vue.js (Vue is using 'embedded' to hilight Javascript and CSS)


v0.4.0
------

BREAKING: refacto removed all buffer thing, instead one should use the more generic and flexible 'span'
bufferBranches is replaced by spanBranches, and it's nested inside a regular branch
it's now possible to continue a span, restart it, force expand it (even if there is a missing part), and copy it to another one
return is refactored, it is an object (or true) with optional properties matchState, matchMicroState and errorAction (former returnErrorAction)
XML highlighter refined
