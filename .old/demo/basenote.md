welcome to a basic note. there is no need to write title and description, as those are already within the frontmatter.

> since this is marked as `md` in the extension, it will render as such, and utilize **markdown highlighting** such as:

* lists
* indents
* other markdown features

this is a footer, not necessary, I just like them
