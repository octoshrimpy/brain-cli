## todo
_holds one or more sub-tasks_

* has:
  * id
  * archivalState
  * tag(s)
  * timestamp
  * priority
  * completionStatus
  * title
  * box:task

```md
---
@id         [id goes here]
@unix       [unix timestamp]
@tags       #tag #tag1 #tag2
@archived   true 
---

# [ ][ ] Title of todo
     [ ] task
     [ ] task
```


## task
_child of todo, contains a single action_

* has:
  * completionStatus
  * content
  * timestamp
  * id

```md
---
@id         [id goes here]
@unix       [unix timestamp]
---

[ ] name of thing to do
```


## book
_holds one or more notes_

* has: 
  * title
  * archivalState
  * box:note
  * directoryPath
  * tag(s)
  * id
  * childInheritance

```md
---
@id         [id goes here]
@tags       #tag #tag1 #tag2
@archived   true 
---

# Title of book

### [[note1]]
### [[note2]]
```


## note

* has:
  * id
  * archivalState
  * tag(s)
  * inherited tag(s)
  * timestamp

  * content

```md

@id         [id goes here]
@archived   true 

@tags       #tag #tag1 #tag2
@inherits   #tag3 #tag4
@unix       [unix timestamp]

# Title of note

this is note content, in md/txt form
```


#### idea
_holds a thought to ponder about later_
_inherits metadata from note_

* has: 
  * title - main idea

#### snip
_hold a bit of code, for quick copypasta_
_inherits metadata from note_

* has:

#### log
_timestamped entry of occurences_

* has:
  * timestamp
  * content


#### card
_flashcard for knowledge-checking_
_inherits metadata from note_

* has: 
  * timestamp
  * archivalState
  * todoStatus
  * priority

## hotkey design

ctrl    - base command key
shift   - `plus` modifier, adds more to selections


## ideas

* when modifying a task, create log accordingly
* when modifying a todo, create log accordingly
* what if note IDs has the book as a preface
  * 28s1:2f83gg9
  * 28s1:gj590f2
* @created, @changed instead of @unix
* docker/server that handles API calls, and runs commands, converts them to json, and returns
  * for any frontend
  * auth?
  * single server per person? multi person?
* filepicker/dirbrowser in a popup modal
  * fzf/ripgrep
  * thin
    * tree-style, no previews
  * full
    * ranger-like, with content previews
  * what if notes had templates
    * types above were the basic templates shipped
  * git tracking from the main directory where books are kept
