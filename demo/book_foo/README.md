# Foo

this is book `Foo`

it contains notes, being a note itself. this note is stored in the README of the book, while the other notes are stored within the folder itself

wiki links do not work, but regular markdown urls with relative paths do

* [note in same book, note the `:` at the start](:internal_folder/inner.txt)
* [using `~` tells the system to find the first match it finds](:~inner.txt)
* [note in a different book](book_bar:bar_file.md)
* [you can also leave out file extensions](book_bar:bar_file)
* [and use `~` to grab book names](~bar:bar_file)
